How to run:

  - Open 2 terminal windows and go to the directory where you saved the java classes (src)
  - In one terminal compile the server then run it with "javac Server.java" and "java Server"
  - In the other terminal compile and run the Client with one argument "java Client `client name`"
  
  Type any message on the client terminal and see it on the server side. Disconnect the client or stop the server with `CTRL-C`
  
  To run the test, just compile and run the Test.java file and see 3 clients connected simulaneously.
